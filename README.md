# Java DSA Mini Project

This project was developed as part of my academic coursework in the "Data Structures and Algorithms" module at [Your University Name]. It demonstrates the use of various data structures and hashing techniques to process and manage textual data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **`MiniProject.java`**: The main entry point of the application.
- **`CharArray.java`**: A custom character array implementation for internal data handling.
- **`QuadraticProbingHashTable.java`**: Implements a hash table using quadratic probing for collision resolution.
- **`WordLinkedList.java`**: A linked list to store and manage words, including functionalities like removing duplicates and generating files.

## ðŸ›  Features
1. **Text Processing**: Reads words from a file, validates, and processes them.
2. **Hashing**: Implements quadratic probing to handle collisions.
3. **File Generation**: Outputs results to structured text files for further analysis.
4. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminates duplicate entries from the dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Tasks Demonstrated
1. Reading and processing data from files.
2. Using a linked list to manage words and their associated values.
3. Implementing a quadratic probing hash table for efficient storage.
4. Generating formatted output files.

## ðŸ“¦ Input and Output
- **Input**: A text file named `file<n>.txt` containing unprocessed data, where `<n>` corresponds to the first digit of a registration number.
- **Output**: 
  - `wordsHK<n>.txt`: Words with associated values after processing.
  - `wordsQHK<n>.txt`: Words stored in a hash table with associated hash keys.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-dsa-miniproject.git
